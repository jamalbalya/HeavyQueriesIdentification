This script is a user-friendly graphical interface application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to effortlessly connect to either a PostgreSQL or MySQL database, efficiently process and display complex queries, and monitor them in real-time.

Here, I'll describe the main components and functionalities of the application in a more human-like manner:

Imports:
The script imports essential modules for its functionality. Tkinter is used for creating the graphical interface, psycopg2 is employed for PostgreSQL database connections, mysql.connector is used for MySQL database connections, and threading is utilized to manage asynchronous monitoring.

Constants:
Within the script, a constant named DEFAULT_THRESHOLD is defined to establish the default threshold value, measured in milliseconds. This value helps identify queries that are considered "heavy." Users can customize this threshold as per their specific requirements.

Functions:
The application consists of several functions to support its core operations:

    identify_heavy_queries_postgres(database_url, threshold, output_text):
    This function enables users to connect to a PostgreSQL database using a provided URL. It then identifies queries that surpass the specified threshold in execution time. The details of these "heavy" queries are displayed in the output_text widget.

    identify_heavy_queries_mysql(database_config, threshold, output_text):
    This function facilitates connections to a MySQL database using the provided connection database_config. It identifies heavy queries that exceed the specified threshold and presents the query details in the output_text widget.

    process_heavy_queries():
    Whenever users click the "Process Heavy Queries" button, this function is triggered. It collects the necessary user input, determines the selected database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL), and then calls the appropriate function to identify heavy queries accordingly.

    start_monitoring():
    Upon clicking the "Start Monitoring" button, this function is activated. It initiates real-time monitoring of heavy queries, with updates at five-second intervals. The selected database type and connection details are used to call the relevant function for identifying heavy queries.

    stop_monitoring():
    If users wish to halt the monitoring of heavy queries, they can click the "Stop Monitoring" button, which triggers this function.

    clear_output_text():
    For the convenience of users, this function allows them to clear the contents of the output_text widget.

    close_window():
    When users decide to close the application by clicking the "Close" button, this function is called. It stops any ongoing monitoring (if active) and gracefully closes the main GUI window.

GUI Setup:
The script creates a user-friendly graphical interface window using Tkinter's tk.Tk() class and sets its title and dimensions.

Within the GUI, radio buttons enable users to easily select between PostgreSQL and MySQL database types.

For database connection details, input fields and labels are provided, allowing users to conveniently enter the URL, host, port, database name, user, and password.

A text widget (output_text) is utilized to display valuable information related to heavy queries. To avoid unintended modifications by users, the widget is set to read-only mode.

The application also offers buttons for users to effortlessly process heavy queries, start or stop real-time monitoring, clear output data, and close the application window.

Event Handlers:
To link user actions with corresponding functions, event handlers are assigned to various buttons:

    The "Process Heavy Queries" button triggers the process_heavy_queries() function.
    When users click the "Start Monitoring" button, it activates the start_monitoring() function, which runs in a separate thread to ensure the GUI remains responsive during monitoring.
    Clicking the "Stop Monitoring" button prompts the stop_monitoring() function to stop the ongoing monitoring process.
    For clearing the output_text widget, the "Clear" button is associated with the clear_output_text() function.
    Finally, the "Close" button is linked to the close_window() function, which gracefully stops monitoring (if active) and closes the main GUI window.

Main Loop:
To handle user interactions and events, the application's GUI main loop is initiated using the root.mainloop() method.

Please note that to run the script correctly, you must have the necessary dependencies (tkinter, psycopg2, mysql.connector) installed in your Python environment. Additionally, ensure that you provide valid database connection details to establish a connection with the chosen database type.
